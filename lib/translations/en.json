      "p2": "Since moving to California in 2007 to study and work at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, her path has been rooted in both depth psychology and the dharma.",
      "p3": "Her approach invites presence, warmth, and deep listening — guiding others to rest, reconnect, and rediscover the wisdom that speaks through dreams and silence alike.",
      "p4": "Isabel's work draws from years of immersion in both Western depth psychology and Eastern contemplative traditions. She has studied Jungian analysis, Buddhist meditation, and somatic practices, weaving these threads into a unique approach that honors the wholeness of the human experience."

      "title": "Approach & Philosophy",
      "quote": "A path of listening — where therapy, meditation, and dreams converge as ways to return home to the self.",
      "p1": "Isabel's work is grounded in the belief that healing is not about fixing or becoming someone other than who you are. Rather, it is about listening — to the unconscious, to the body, to the dreams that visit in the night, and to the silence that holds everything.",
      "p2": "From Jung, she brings an understanding of the psyche as a living, symbolic realm — where dreams speak in images and the unconscious guides us toward individuation, the lifelong journey of becoming whole.",
      "p3": "From the dharma, she brings practices of presence, compassion, and the recognition that suffering and freedom are both woven into the fabric of being human. Meditation becomes a way to rest in what is, to meet experience with openness rather than resistance."
